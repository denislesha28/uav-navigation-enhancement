# Sensor Error Compensation in UAV Navigation: Performance Analysis

## Sensor Error Characteristics & Implementation
- **GPS errors**: x (2.22m), y (3.76m), z (5.46m)
- **IMU errors**: Accelerometer bias (0.5-5 mg), Cross-axis sensitivity (0.5-2%), Scale factor errors (0.1-0.5%)
- **Applied corrections**: 
  - Base: Basic gravity compensation, fixed gyroscope bias (2.4e-6 rad/s)
  - Enhanced: Comprehensive gravity compensation, scale factors, cross-axis sensitivity, temperature compensation, bias drift modeling

| MAE    | 0.2177 | 0.0920 | -57.7% |
| R²     | 0.6886 | 0.6876 | -0.1% |
| 2D Error | 0.5912 | 0.2075 | -64.9% |
| Z Error | 0.2439 | 0.1270 | -47.9% |
| Accel Bias Z RMSE | 0.8398 | 0.0736 | -91.2% |
| Gyro Bias X RMSE | 0.0484 | 0.0616 | +27.3% |

## Key Findings
1. Enhanced sensor error compensation dramatically improved overall positioning accuracy (54.7% RMSE reduction)
2. Most significant improvement in accelerometer bias estimation (91.2% for z-axis)
3. Position error metrics showed substantial gains (64.9% reduction in 2D error)
4. Slight regression in gyroscope x-axis bias estimation and overall R² (-0.1%)
5. Results validate Chen et al. (2024) approach to sensor error modeling in UAV navigation
